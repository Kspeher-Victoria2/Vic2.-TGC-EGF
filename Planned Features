-More treaties
-Ability to form a "Reichspakt" or at least an economical union thru use of modifiers
-Flavors to the new colonies
-Some new renaming decisions, the following list has the ones that I'm currently working on
*Swedish names for Estonia and parts of Russia
*Polish names for Pomerania and East Prussia, with parts of Belarus and Ukraine (pre-WW2 borders)
*Dutch Names for the Rhineland...chose why not?
*Swedish names for Pomerania, like it had when Sweden owned it
